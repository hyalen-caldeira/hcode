Hello and Welcome to an exciting system of Algorithms Control where I'm developing an 
end-to-end full stack algorithm app similar to LeetCode.

Iâ€™ve built the backend server using Spring Boot where I used Spring Security along 
with JWT authentication. The app configuration model was developed using Spring Cloud.
For storage I'm using MySQL database.

The front-end application was built using React. I've also used React Bootstrap for 
designing the user interface.

The application was totally developed from scratch and you can get all the source code
hosted on GitHub as reference for a complete full stack application.
